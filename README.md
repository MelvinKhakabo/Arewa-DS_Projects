# Arewa-DS_Projects

This repo contains my Project Submission for Arewa-DS Fellowship Python Programming Cohort 3.0
There are different parts of the Project:

## Generating_Data
In this section we’ll use Python to generate data for a random walk and then use matplotlib to create a visually appealing representation of the generated data. 

A random walk is a path that has no clear direction but is determined by a series of random decisions, each of which is left entirely to chance. 

You might imagine a random walk as the path an ant would take if it had lost its mind and took every step in a random direction.Random walks have practical applications in nature, physics, biology, chemistry, and economics. 

For example, a pollen grain floating on a drop of water moves across the surface of the water because it is constantly being pushed around by water molecules. Molecular motion in a water drop is random, so the path a pollen grain traces out on the surface is a random walk. The code we’re about to write models many real-world situations.



## Downloading_Data
We’ll access and visualize data stored in two common data formats, 
CSV and JSON. We’ll use Python’s csv module to process weather data 
stored in the CSV (comma-separated values) format and analyze high 
and low temperatures over time in two different locations. We’ll then use 
matplotlib to generate a chart based on our downloaded data 
variations in temperature in two very different environments: Sitka, Alaska, 
and Death Valley, California
