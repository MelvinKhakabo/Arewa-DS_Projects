# Arewa-DS_Projects

This repo contains my Project Submission for Arewa-DS Fellowship Python Programming Cohort 3.0

In this section we’ll use Python to generate data for a random walk and then use matplotlib to create a visually appealing representation of the generated data. 

A random walk is a path that has no clear direction but is determined by a series of random decisions, each of which is left entirely to chance. 

You might imagine a random walk as the path an ant would take if it had lost its mind and took every step in a random direction.Random walks have practical applications in nature, physics, biology, chemistry, and economics. 

For example, a pollen grain floating on a drop of water moves across the surface of the water because it is constantly being pushed around by water molecules. Molecular motion in a water drop is random, so the path a pollen grain traces out on the surface is a random walk. The code we’re about to write models many real-world situations.
