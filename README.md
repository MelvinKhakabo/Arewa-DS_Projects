# Arewa-DS_Projects

This repo contains my Project Submission for Arewa-DS Fellowship Python Programming Cohort 3.0
There are different parts of the Project:

## Generating_Data
In this section we’ll use Python to generate data for a random walk and then use matplotlib to create a visually appealing representation of the generated data. 
A random walk is a path that has no clear direction but is determined by a series of random decisions, each of which is left entirely to chance. 
You might imagine a random walk as the path an ant would take if it had lost its mind and took every step in a random direction.Random walks have practical applications in nature, physics, biology, chemistry, and economics. 


## Downloading_Data
We’ll access and visualize data stored in CSV format. We’ll use Python’s csv module to process weather data 
stored in the CSV (comma-separated values) format and analyze high and low temperatures over time in two different locations. We’ll then use matplotlib to generate a chart based on our downloaded data ariations in temperature in two very different environments: Sitka, Alaska, 
and Death Valley, California


## API_Integration
In this project, We’ll base our visualization on information from GitHub, a site that allows programmers to collaborate on projects. We’ll use GitHub’s API to 
request information about Python projects on the site and then generate 
an interactive visualization of the relative popularity of these projects in 
Pygal.
